In 12.2, the merging from $G is done automatically during sync index (or commit if sync-on-commit is used) when the stage_itab_max_rows value is reached. This value is typically 1M by default. 

Therefore if $G only has 124 rows, no merging will be performed. 

It is no longer necessary to register the merge job via exec ctx_ddl.add_auto_optimize('docindex',optlevel=>'MERGE'); 

In fact this is disabled (you get the DRG-13904) unless the user changes the stage_itab_max_rows to be equal to 0. A value of 0 let's the user over-ride the automatic 12.2. behavior. 
Regardless of the value of stage_itab_max_rows, the user can always perform a "manual" merge via the following API: 

exec ctx_ddl.optimize_index('idx_name', part_name=>'partition_name', 'merge'); 

where they specify the idx_name, part_name. 

With this API, they can always "force a merge". 

If ctx logging is enabled (for example: alter system set events 'TRACE[CONTEXT_INDEX] disk=low') 
Then the trace file will show when/if a merge has happened and how many rows there were in $G. 

The current value for stage_itab_max_rows can be checked as follows: 

select prv_attribute from ctx_preference_values where PRV_ATTRIBUTE='STAGE_ITAB_MAX_ROWS';
